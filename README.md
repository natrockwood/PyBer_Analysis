This is the full analysis for the driver, city, and ride data of the datasets provided.

## Summary of the Data
In the summary data shown below, the more rides occur in Urban Cities, while the least number of rides occur in the Rural cities. However, the average fare per ride is less in Urban cities due to the high number of rides.
Rural cities also have the least number of drivers which leads to a higher average fare per driver price.
