# PyBer_Analysis
This is the full analysis for the driver, city, and ride data of the datasets provided.

## Summary of the Data
In the summary data shown below, the more rides occur in Urban Cities, while the least number of rides occur in the Rural cities. However, the average fare per ride is less in Urban cities due to the high number of rides.
Urban cities have more driviers that they do rides, which is why their average fare per driver is low.
Rural cities also have the least number of drivers which leads to a higher average fare per driver price.

## Summary of Cities Over Time
As seen in the data below, there is no set trend for fare over the months. It fluctuates in all areas with multiple peaks and valleys. March through April seem to be the months with the most fluctuation. towards the summer months, fares decrease for rural and urban cities, while there's a significant increase in suburban cities.

All in all, all cities fluctuate fares at around the same time of year.

## Summary of Both Analysis
When looking at the two charts above, it shows that the number of rides and drivers direct relate to the total fares the cities accumulate. The total fare and rides do no depend on seasonality, but depend on the number of drivers. It would be nice to see a comparison of Drivers by Month to see if their availability is seasonal, and compare that to the "Pyber Fare by Month" graph.
